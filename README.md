## Conventions for new CLI integration

### Package (integration) name

- If namespaced it SHOULD be `@fig/complete[-_]($FRAMEWORK_NAME)`
- If not namespaced it SHOULD be `($FRAMEWORK_NAME)[-_]complete[-_]fig`

According to language conventions you can use a dash or an underscore to separate the words.

Examples:
- `@fig/complete-commander`
- `@fig/complete-oclif`
- `clap_complete_fig`

### Name of the default subcommand added to the CLI

Most of our CLI integration tools allow to set the name of the subcommand added to the CLI but we also provide a default value for that.
That default name MUST be `generate-fig-spec` such that running `$CLI generate-fig-spec` prints the spec.

### Function that adds the command

The functions exported from the integration can:
- Create a new framework subcommand which will print the spec when invoked
- Generate a spec and return it

In both cases the names are standardized and SHOULD be:
- `addCompletionSpecCommand` of `createCompletionSpecCommand` for function creating a new subcommand
- `generateCompletionSpec` for functions that return the spec as a string

According to language conventions these function names can be transformed to snake case, etc...

### Docs on `public-site-nextjs`

Docs MUST conform to the rules listed above too.
