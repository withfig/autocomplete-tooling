# Migration docs

## @withfig/oclif@2 to @fig/complete-oclif@3

The first granted thing you can note is that we renamed the package to use the `@fig` namespace and a more significative name.

In this major we changed the name of the subcommand that gets added to the CLI from `generateFigSpec` to `generate-fig-spec`.
