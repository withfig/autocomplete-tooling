## Generic workflow

2. Once you got some feedback you can fork the repo and clone in on your machine
3. Run `yarn` in the root of the monorepo to get the deps installed
4. Work on the new feature/fix
5. Push to your fork
6. Open a PR
7. Enjoy the feat/fix live!

## Structure of the repo

We are using yarn workspaces in this repo, so the source files of each package are in the appropriate folder under `packages/`.
Concerning `npm` commands there are some global ones available from the root of the monorepo and some other relative to the packages.

## What is a good PR?

A good PR should have tests if applicable and some kind of description telling what changes were done.
